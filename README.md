- `ALDS1`: Solutions for the "Algorithm and Data Structures I" course.
- `DPL`: Solutions for the "Dynamic Programming" course.
- `GRL`: Solutions for the "Graph Algorithms" course.
- `ITP1`: Solutions for the "Introduction to Programming I" course.
- `NTL`: Solutions for the "Number Theory" course.

Each directory contains individual files, usually named according to the problem ID on AOJ.
